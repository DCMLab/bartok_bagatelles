DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 15, '0', 'I(139)') ms3.Parse.bartok_bagatelles.op06n11
	The label 'I(139)' in m. 15, onset 0 (MC 15, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of b.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('1', '#3', '5') [('B', 'D#', 'F#')] plus the added ('6', '2') [('G', 'C#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 5 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.7142857142857143 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
