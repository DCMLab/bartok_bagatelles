DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 105, '1/4', 'V6') ms3.Parse.bartok_bagatelles.op06n14
	The label 'V6' in m. 105, onset 1/4 (MC 105, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of D.I, it expresses the scale degrees
	('7', '2', '5') [('C#', 'E', 'A')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
