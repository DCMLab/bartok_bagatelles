DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 18, '0', 'V7(+b6)/V') ms3.Parse.bartok_bagatelles.op06n08
	The label 'V7(+b6)/V' in m. 18, onset 0 (MC 18, onset 0) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of B.bVI, it expresses the scale degrees
	('2', '#4', '6', '1') [('A', 'C#', 'E', 'G')] plus the added ('b7',) [('F',)].
	The corresponding score segment has 5 within-label and 11 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6875 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
