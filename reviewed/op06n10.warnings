============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 43, '1/2', 'vii%65/#iv') ms3.Parse.bartok_bagatelles.op06n10
	The label 'vii%65/#iv' in m. 43, onset 1/2 (MC 43, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of F.I, it expresses the scale degrees
	('5', 'b7', '2', '3') [('C', 'Eb', 'G', 'A')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
