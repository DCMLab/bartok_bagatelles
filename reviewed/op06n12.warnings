DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 3, '1/2', 'viM7') ms3.Parse.bartok_bagatelles.op06n12 --
	The label 'viM7' in m. 3, onset 1/2 (MC 3, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).

	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 8 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.8888888888888888 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
