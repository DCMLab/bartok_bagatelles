WARNING  ms3.Parse.bartok_bagatelles.op06n02 --
	MC 24: VM42(b109): M requires figbass (7, 65, 43, or 2) since it specifies a chord's seventh.
WARNING  ms3.Parse.bartok_bagatelles.op06n02 --
	MC 24: VM42(b109): M requires figbass (7, 65, 43, or 2) since it specifies a chord's seventh.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 9, '1/2', 'IV64(13)') ms3.Parse.bartok_bagatelles.op06n02 --
	The label 'IV64(13)' in m. 9, onset 1/2 (MC 9, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of Db.I, it expresses the scale degrees ('1', '4', '6') [('Db', 'Gb', 'Bb')] plus the added ('2',) [('Eb',)].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 7 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.

	The label 'i6(+14+13)' in m. 13, onset 1/2 (MC 13, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of Db.I, it expresses the scale degrees ('b3', '5', '1') [('Fb', 'Ab', 'Db')] plus the added ('7', '6') [('C', 'Bb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).

	The label 'bii6' in m. 13, onset 3/4 (MC 13, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of Db.I, it expresses the scale degrees ('b4', 'b6', 'b2') [('Gbb', 'Bbb', 'Ebb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 8 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
